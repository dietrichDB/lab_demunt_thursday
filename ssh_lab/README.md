1. Create Public/Private Key Pair on Ubuntu or your OS X

THIS KEYPAIR IS PRIVATE - NEVER CHANGE THE PRIVATE PART WITH 3D PARTIES!!!!

Key generation on your Linux VM:

Key Generation on Windows:

Importing the PRIVATE key to the linux vm (as client machine) - NEVER do this elsewhere unless this is explicitely your plan. (if not needed, create new keypair for the specific machine).
